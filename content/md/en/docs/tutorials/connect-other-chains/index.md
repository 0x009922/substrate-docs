The **Connect other chains** tutorials delve into more advanced topics for moving beyond solo chain development, including how to connect your chain to other chains.

## Tutorials under construction

- [Prepare a local relay chain](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/prepare-a-local-relay-chain/) helps you prepare a local relay chain to use in testing a local parachain.
- [Connect a local parachain](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/connect-a-local-parachain/) highlights the steps necessary to connect your local parachain to a relay chain.
- [Acquire a testnet slot](/tutorials/connect-other-chains/acquire-a-testnet-slot/) summarizes the steps for connecting a parachain to the Rococo test network.
