This section provides reference information for the cross-consensus message (XCM) format.

## Instructions

As you learned in [Cross-consensus communication](/fundamentals/xcm-communication), the XCM executor is a program that executes an ordered set of instructions as a virtual machine running on recipient consensus system.
It's worth noting that some instructions are dependent on other instructions.
The order in which instructions are listed in the Instruction enumeration and defined when you construct a message to be sent to the receiving system reflects these dependencies. 
For your convenience in this reference section, the instructions are listed in alphabetic order instead of the order in which they are defined.

### BuyExecution

Pays for the execution of the current message by removing assets from the holding register. 
You must specify the `fees` parameter using the `MultiAsset` type to identify the asset to remove from the holding register to pay execution fees. 
You can also specify a `weight_limit` for the maximum fee to be purchased. 
If the `weight_limit` you specify is lower than the estimated weight of the message, the XCM executor stops execution with the `TooExpensive` error.

### ClaimAsset

Creates assets that are being held on behalf of the location identified in the origin register. 
You must specify the `assets` parameter using the `MultiAsset` type to identify the assets to be claimed. 
The asset you specify must match exactly with the assets available to be claimed by the origin with the given `ticket`. 
You must specify the `ticket` using the `MultiLocation` type. 
The claim ticket for the asset is an abstract identifier to help locate the asset to be claimed.

### ClearError

Clears the error register.

### ClearOrigin

Clears the origin register. 
You can use this instruction to ensure that later instructions cannot take over the authority of the original origin. 
For example, if you have instructions that are being relayed from an untrusted source, as is often the case with ReserveAssetDeposited, you can use ClearOrigin to prevent the original origin from being used to execute the instruction.

### DepositAsset

Subtracts the specified asset from the holding register and deposits on-chain equivalent assets under the ownership of specified `beneficiary`. 
You must specify the `assets` to remove using the `MultiAssetFilter` type.
Because the holding register might have assets of different typesâ€”for example
| Parameter | Description
| :-------- | :----------
| `assets: MultiAssetFilter` | Specifies the asset to remove from the holding register.
| `max_assets: Compact` | Specifies the maximum number of unique assets or asset instances to remove from the holding register. Only the first `max_assets` number of unique assets or asset instances that match the `assets` specified are removed, prioritized under standard asset ordering. If there are any additional unique assets or asset instances, they will remain in the holding register.
| `destination: MultiLocation` | Specifies the location whose sovereign account will own the assets and thus the effective beneficiary for the assets and the notification target for the reserve asset deposit message.

max_assets: Compact: The maximum number of unique assets/asset instances to remove from the Holding Register. Only the first max_assets assets/instances of those matched by assets will be removed, prioritized under standard asset ordering. Any others will remain in holding.
beneficiary: MultiLocation: The new owner for the assets.

### DepositReserveAsset

Removes the assets from the holding register and deposits on-chain equivalent assets into the sovereign account under the ownership of the destination.
This instruction also sends a follow-up message to destination of the ReserveAssetDeposited instruction with the given effects.
  
| Parameter | Description
| :-------- | :----------
| `assets: MultiAssetFilter` | Specifies the asset to remove from the holding register.
| `max_assets: Compact` | Specifies the maximum number of unique assets or asset instances to remove from the holding register. Only the first `max_assets` number of unique assets or asset instances that match the `assets` specified are removed, prioritized under standard asset ordering. If there are any additional unique assets or asset instances, they will remain in the holding register.
| `destination: MultiLocation` | Specifies the location whose sovereign account will own the assets and thus the effective beneficiary for the assets and the notification target for the reserve asset deposit message.
| `xcm: Xcm `| Specifies the orders that should follow the ReserveAssetDeposited instruction that is sent onwards to destination.

### DescendOrigin

Changes the origin to some interior location.

| Parameter | Description
| :-------- | :----------
| `interior: InteriorMultiLocation` | Specifies the location, interpreted from the context of the current origin, to place in the origin register.

Kind: Instruction

Errors: Fallible.

### HrmpChannelAccepted

A message to notify about that a previously sent open channel request has been accepted by the recipient. That means that the channel will be opened during the next Relay-chain session change. This message is meant to be sent by the Relay-chain to a para.

Operands:

recipient: Compact: The recipient parachain which has accepted the previous open-channel request.
Safety: The message should originate directly from the Relay-chain.

Kind: System Notification

Errors: Fallible.

### HrmpChannelClosing

A message to notify that the other party in an open channel decided to close it. In particular, initiator is going to close the channel opened from sender to the recipient. The close will be enacted at the next Relay-chain session change. This message is meant to be sent by the Relay-chain to a para.

Operands:

initiator: Compact: The parachain index which initiated this close operation.
sender: Compact: The parachain index of the sender side of the channel being closed.
recipient: Compact: The parachain index of the receiver side of the channel being closed.

Sends a request from a parachain to the relay chain to notify about a new incoming HRMP channel. This message is meant to be sent by the Relay-chain to a para.

Operands:

sender: Compact: The sender in the to-be opened channel. Also, the initiator of the channel opening.
max_message_size: Compact: The maximum size of a message proposed by the sender.
max_capacity: Compact: The maximum number of messages that can be queued in the channel.

Operands:

assets: MultiAssetFilter: The asset(s) to remove from the Holding Register.
reserve: A valid location that acts as a reserve for all asset(s) in assets. The sovereign account of this consensus system on the reserve location will have appropriate assets withdrawn and effects will be executed on them. There will typically be only one valid location on any given asset/chain combination.
xcm: The instructions to execute on the assets once withdrawn on the reserve location.
Kind: Instruction

Errors: Fallible.

### InitiateTeleport

Remove the asset(s) (assets) from the Holding Register and send an XCM message beginning with ReceiveTeleportedAsset to a destination location.

Kind: Information.

Errors: Fallible.

Weight: Weight estimation may utilise max_weight which may lead to an increase in Surplus Weight Register at run-time.

Response
The Response type is used to express information content in the QueryResponse XCM instruction. It can represent one of several different data types and it therefore encoded as the SCALE-encoded tagged union:

Null = 0: No information.
Assets { assets: MultiAssets } = 1: Some assets.
ExecutionResult { result: Result<(), (u32, Error)> } = 2: An error (or not), equivalent to the type of value contained in the Error Register.

Kind: Instruction.

Errors: Fallible.

Weight: Weight estimation may utilise max_weight which may lead to an increase in Surplus Weight Register at run-time.

### TransferAsset

}

enum AssetId {
   Concrete(MultiLocation),
   Abstract(BinaryBlob),
}

enum Fungibility {
   Fungible(NonZeroAmount),
   NonFungible(AssetInstance),
}
```

The asset must be owned by the location identified in the origin register.

Kind: Instruction.

Errors: Fallible.

Notes on terminology
When the term Origin is used, it is meant to mean "location whose value is that of the Origin Register". Thus the phrase "controlled by the Origin" is equivalent to "controlled by the location whose value is that of the Origin Register".
When the term Holding is used, it is meant to mean "value of the Holding Register". Thus the phrase "reduce Holding by the asset" is equivalent to "reduce the value of the Holding Register by the asset".
Similarly for Appendix (the value of the Appendix Register) and Error Handler (the value of the Error Handler Register).
The term on-chain should be taken to mean "within the persistent state of the local consensus system", and should not be considered to limit the current consensus system to one which is specifically a blockchain system.
The type Compact, Weight and QueryId should be intended to mean a compact integer as per the SCALE definition.
WithdrawAsset













BurnAsset(MultiAssets)

ExpectationFalse: If Holding does not contain the assets in the parameter.
ExpectOrigin(MultiLocation)
Ensure that the Origin Register equals some given value and throw an error if not.

Operands:

origin: MultiLocation: The value expected of the Origin Register.
Kind: Instruction

Errors:

ExpectationFalse: If Origin is not some value, or if that value is not equal to the parameter.
ExpectError(Option<(u32, Error)>)
Ensure that the Error Register equals some given value and throw an error if not.

Operands:

error: Option<(u32, Error)>: The value expected of the Error Register.
Kind: Instruction

Errors:

ExpectationFalse: If the value of the Error Register is not equal to the parameter.

## Registers

Most XCVM registers can't be modified directly.
They are set to specific values to start and are only be manipulated by specific instructions, under certain circumstances, or according to certain rules.
The XCVM includes the following registers:

| Register | Description
| :------- | :----------
| Origin | Stores the location for the authority the current program is running under.
| Holding | Stores the number of assets that exist under the control of the XCVM but have no on-chain representation. 
| Surplus weight | Stores the overestimation of weight previously calculated.
| Refunded weight | Stores the portion of surplus weight that has been refunded. 
| Programme | Stores the set of XCM instructions currently executing. This register holds the complete messageâ€”the programâ€”in cross-consensus virtual machine.
| Programme counter | Stores the instruction index for currently executing instruction. The value is incremented by one at the end of every successfully executed instruction. The register is reset to zero when the Programme register changes.
| Error | Stores information about the last known error during program execution. 
| Error handler | Stores code that should run if there's an error.
| Appendix | Stores code that should run after the current program ends.

## Origins

/// Origin should just be the native dispatch origin representation for the sender in the
/// local runtime framework. For Cumulus/Frame chains this is the `Parachain` or `Relay` origin
/// if coming from a chain, though there may be others if the `MultiLocation` XCM origin has a
/// primary/native dispatch origin form.
Native,

    /// Origin should just be the standard account-based origin with the sovereign account of
    /// the sender. For Cumulus/Frame chains, this is the `Signed` origin.
    SovereignAccount,

    /// Origin should be the super-user. For Cumulus/Frame chains, this is the `Root` origin.
    /// This will not usually be an available option.
    Superuser,

    /// Origin should be interpreted as an XCM native origin and the `MultiLocation` should be
    /// encoded directly in the dispatch origin unchanged. For Cumulus/Frame chains, this will be
    /// the `pallet_xcm::Origin::Xcm` type.
    Xcm,

The implications of using different origins depends on the code you are calling, and if you are able to generate that origin at all.

For example, it would not be normal for a regular user to be able to generate the Superuser origin, but it may be possible for the chain logic itself to do that. Having access to the Superuser origin will allow you to use configurations like ParentAsSuperuser which specifically check for these things:

pub struct ParentAsSuperuser<RuntimeOrigin>(PhantomData<RuntimeOrigin>);
impl<RuntimeOrigin: OriginTrait> ConvertOrigin<RuntimeOrigin> for ParentAsSuperuser<RuntimeOrigin> {
    fn convert_origin(
        origin: impl Into<MultiLocation>,
        kind: OriginKind,
    ) -> Result<RuntimeOrigin, MultiLocation> {
        let origin = origin.into();
        log::trace!(target: "xcm::origin_conversion", "ParentAsSuperuser origin: {:?}, kind: {:?}", origin, kind);
        if kind == OriginKind::Superuser && origin.contains_parents_only(1) {
            Ok(RuntimeOrigin::root())
        } else {
            Err(origin)
        }
    }
}

## Errors

If the program executing XCM instructions encounters a problem, it stops execution and identifies the type of problem encountered with one of the following errors:

| Error type | Description
| :---------- | :-----------
| `Overflow = 0` | An instruction caused an arithmetic overflow.
| `Unimplemented = 1` | The instruction is intentionally unsupported.
| `UntrustedReserveLocation = 2` | The origin register doesn't contain a valid value for a reserve transfer notification.
| `UntrustedTeleportLocation = 3` | The origin register doesn't contain a valid value for a teleport notification.
| `MultiLocationFull = 4` | The `MultiLocation` value too large to descend further.
| `MultiLocationNotInvertible = 5` | The `MultiLocation` value ascends more parents than the known number of ancestors of the local location.
| `BadOrigin = 6` | The origin register doesn't contain a valid value for executing the instruction.
| `InvalidLocation = 7` | The location parameter is not a valid value for the instruction.
| `AssetNotFound = 8` | The specified asset can't be found or isn't valid in the location specified for the instruction.
| `FailedToTransactAsset = 9` | An asset transactionâ€”for example, an instruction to withdraw or deposit an assetâ€”failed. In most cases, this type of error is caused by problems with type conversions.
| `NotWithdrawable = 10` | The specified asset can't be withdrawn, potentially due to lack of ownership, asset availability, or permissions.
| `LocationCannotHold = 11` | The specified asset can't be deposited under the ownership of a particular location.
| `ExceedsMaxMessageSize = 12` | There was an attempt to send a message that exceeded the maximum message size supported by the transport protocol.
| `DestinationUnsupported = 13` | There was an attempt to send a message that can't be translated into a format supported by the destination.
| `Transport = 14` | The destination is routable, but there's an issue with the transport mechanism.
| `Unroutable = 15` | The destination is known to be unroutable.
| `UnknownClaim = 16` | The claim specified for the ClaimAsset instruction isn't recognized or can't be found.
| `FailedToDecode = 17` | The function specified for the Transact instruction can't be decoded.
| `TooMuchWeightRequired = 18` | The function specified for the Transact instruction might exceed the weight limit allowed.
| `NotHoldingFees = 19` | The holding register doesn't contain any payable fees for the BuyExecution instruction to use.
| `TooExpensive = 20` | The fees declared to purchase weight in the BuyExecution instruction are insufficient.
| `Trap(u64) = 21` | Used by the Trap instruction to force an error intentionally. Its code is included.
| `ExpectationFalse = 22` | Used by ExpectAsset, ExpectError, and ExpectOrigin if the expectation was not true.
