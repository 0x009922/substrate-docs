The topics in this section provide a more detailed exploration of the code used to construct the runtime logic, how the logic is compiled to build a Substrate node, and the libraries and tools available for building and interacting with the node.

Relevant context:

- Substrate runtimes are compiled to [both native and Wasm](#native-and-wasm-runtimes).
- Runtimes should be compressed Wasm binaries for on-chain upgrades and relay chain validation capabilities to function correctly.
- Read about the anatomy of a full Substrate node [here](/todo) in order to understand how the client interacts with the runtime.
