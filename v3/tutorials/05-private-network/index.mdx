This tutorial provides a basic introduction to the **consensus** model used in the Substrate node template and how to start a blockchain network with an
**authority set** of private **validators**.

All blockchains require the nodes in the network to agree on the set of messages and their order to successfully create blocks and progress from one block to the next.
Each block represents state at a specific point in time and the nodes agreement on the state is called consensus.
There are several differnt algorithms used to reach consensus, including:

* Proof of work consensus depends on the computational work done by validator nodes to add valid blocks to the chain.

* Proof of stake consensus selects the validators add valid blocks to the chain based on the cryptocurrency holdings that they have locked up as a stake in the network.

* Proof of authority consensus relies on a set of approved account identities to act as validators. The nodes associated with approved accounts have the authority to put transactions into blocks.

The Substrate node template uses a proof of authority consensus model also referred to as **authority round** or **Aura** consensus.
The Aura consensus protocol limits block production to a rotating list of authorized accounts‚Äî**authorities**‚Äîthat create blocks in a round robin fashion.

In this tutorial, you'll see how this consensus model works in practice, first, by using the predefined accounts that are part of the node template, then by adding a new authority to the approved set.

## Start the blockchain using predefined accounts

Before you generate keys to start your own private Substrate network, you can learn the fundamental principles using a predefined network specification called `local` and predefined user accounts.

For this part of the tutorial, you should have the Substrate node template running on a single local computer with predefined accounts that are named Alice and Bob.

### Start the blockchain as Alice

To start the blockchain:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer.

1. Change to the root directory where you compiled the Substrate node template.

1. Purge old chain data by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ./target/release/node-template purge-chain --base-path /tmp/alice --chain local
    ```
    The command prompts you to confirm the operation.

    ```bash
    Are you sure to remove "/tmp/alice/chains/local_testnet/db"? [y/N]:
    ```

1. Type `y` to confirm that you want to remove the chain data.
    
    You should always remove old chain data when starting a new network.

1. Start the local blockchain node using the alice account by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ./target/release/node-template \
    --base-path /tmp/alice \
    --chain local \
    --alice \
    --port 30333 \
    --ws-port 9945 \
    --rpc-port 9933 \
    --node-key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
    --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
    --validator
    ```

#### Review the command-line options

Before moving on, let's take a closer look at the options used to start the node templates.

| <div style="min-width:110pt;font-weight:bold;">Option</div> | <div style="font-weight:bold;">Description</div> |
|:------------------------------ |: ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--base-path` | Specifies the directory for storing all of the data related to this chain. If you don't specify this option, a default path is used. If you specify a directory that doesn'o't exist, it is created for you. If the directory you specify already contains blockchain data, you must remove the data from the directory or choose a different location for the command to start the node to succeed. |
| `--chain local` | Specifies the chain specification to use. Valid predefined chain specifications include `local`, `development`, and `staging`. Generally, you would specify your own chain specification file. You'll see how to create your own chain specification file in a later step. |
| `--alice` | Places the predefined keys for the Alice account in the node's keystore. With this setting, the `alice` account is used for block production and finalization. Generally, you would generate your own keys and insert them with an RPC call. You'll see how to generate your own keys in a later step. |
| `--port 30333` | Specifies the port to listen on for p2p traffic. Port `30333` is the default. You can omit this option to use the default. Because this tutorial uses to nodes running on the same physical computer to simulate a network, you must explicitly specify a different port for at least one account. |
| `--ws-port 9945`  | Specifies the port to listen on for incoming WebSocket traffic. The default value is `9944`. This example uses a custom web socket port number (`9945`). |
| `--rpc-port 9933` | Specifies the port to listen on for incoming RPC traffic. Port `9933` is the default. You can omit this option to use the default. |
| `--node-key <key>` | Specifies the Ed25519 secret key to use for `libp2p` networking. The value is parsed as a hex-encoded Ed25519 32-byte secret key, that is, 64 hex characters. WARNING: Secrets provided as command-line arguments are easily exposed. You should only use this option for development and testing. |
| `--telemetry-url` | Specifies where to send telemetry data. For this tutorial, you can send telemetry data to a server hosted by Parity that is available for anyone to use. You can specify a differnet server or omit this option. |
| `--validator` | Specifies that this node participates in block production and finalization for the network. |

For more information about the command-line options that are available for started the node template, see the usage help by running the following command:

`./target/release/node-template --help`

#### Review the node messages displayed

If the node starts successfully, the terminal displays messages describing network operations. 
For example, you should see output similar to this:

```

```

There are a few key messages you should notice in the output displayed.

* `üî® Initializing Genesis block/state (state: 0xea47‚Ä¶9ba8, header-hash: 0x9d07‚Ä¶7cce)` identifies the initial or **genesis block** that the node is using. 
  When you start the next node, verify that these values are equal.

* `üè∑ Local node identity is: 12D3KooWEyoppNCUx8Yx66oV9fJnriXwCcXwDDUA2kj6vnc6iDEp` shows the peer ID that the node started by Bob will need from Alice's node. This value was determined by the `--node-key` that was used to start Alice's node.
   
* No blocks are being produced yet. Blocks will start being produced once another node joins the network.

### Attach a front-end to see information about the node

You can see a lot of information about node operations by watching the output it produces in your terminal.
You can also view information about node operations by using a web browser to access the Polkadot-JS graphical user interface.

To view node operations using the Polkadot-JS application:

1. Open a web browser.

1. Navigate to the
[Polkadot-JS Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9945#/explorer).
    
  The Polkadot-JS Explorer link uses the `rpc` URL parameter to connect to the local node.

  Some browsers have ad blocking features that prevent connecting to a local node.
  If you have trouble connecting to the local node, see if you have ad blocking enabled and disable it, as needed. 
	If your braowser prevents connections to a local node, try using another browser, like Chromium or downloading and hosting the [Polkadot-JS application](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps#development) locally.

To use Polkadot-JS Explorer to connect to another node:

1. Click the network icon displayed in the top left corner of the Polkadot-JS Explorer page.

  ![Display the list of networks](../../../src/images/tutorials/05-private-network/private-network-top-left-network-icon.png)

1. Expand **DEVELOPMENT** at the bottom of the list of networks available.

  ![Display DEVELOPMENT networks](../../../src/images/tutorials/05-private-network/polkadot-list-networks.png)

1. Verify the custom endpoint is set to `ws://127.0.0.1:9945`.

1. Connect to another node and port by specifying a different IP address or host name and port number for the custom endpoint.
  
  You can use a single instance of the Polkadot-JS application to connect to various nodes. 

1. Click **Switch** to change to the new custom endpoint.

  ![Custom endpoint](../../../src/images/tutorials/05-private-network/private-network-custom-endpoint.png)

You should now see something like this example on the **Network** page.

### Add a node to the blockchain network as Bob

Now that the node you started using the `alice` account keys is running, you can add another node to the network using the `bob` account.
Because you are joining a network that is already running, you will use the running node to bootstrap the new node.
The commands you use here are similar to the ones you used before, but with a few important differences.

To add a node to the running blockchain:

1. Open a new terminal shell on your computer.

1. Change to the root directory where you compiled the Substrate node template.

1. Purge old chain data by running the following command:
        
    ```bash
    ./target/release/node-template purge-chain --base-path /tmp/bob --chain local
    ```

1. Start a second local blockchain node using the `bob` account by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ./target/release/node-template \
    --base-path /tmp/bob \
    --chain local \
    --bob \
    --port 30334 \
    --ws-port 9946 \
    --rpc-port 9934 \
    --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
    --validator \
    --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWEyoppNCUx8Yx66oV9fJnriXwCcXwDDUA2kj6vnc6iDEp
    ```
    
    Take note of the following differences between this command and the previous on.
    
    * Because the two nodes are running on the same physical computer, you must specify different values for the `--base-path`, `--port`, `--ws-port`, and `--rpc-port` options.

    * This command includes the `--bootnodes` option and specifies a single boot node, the node started by `alice` using the following information:
      
      * The IP address for the running node. In this case, the IP address uses the IPv4 (`ip4`) format and the address for the localhost `127.0.0.1`.
      
      * The port number used for peer-to-peer communication. In this case, the port number for TCP traffic is `30333`.
      
      * The peer identifier for the running node that you made note of in the console output. In this case, `12D3KooWEyoppNCUx8Yx66oV9fJnriXwCcXwDDUA2kj6vnc6iDEp`.
      
      After a few seconds, the nodes should connect to each other as peers and start producing blocks. 
      You should see lines like the following in the console that started first node:
      
      ```

      ```
      
      These lines show that the first node started by `alice` has a one peer (`1 peers`), they have produced some blocks (`best: #4 (0x2b8a‚Ä¶fdc4)`), and that the blocks are being finalized (`finalized #2 (0x8b6a‚Ä¶dce6)`).
      
      If you look at the console that started the second node, you should see output.

1. Open the
[Polkadot-JS Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9945#/explorer) to verify the network is producing and finalizing blocks using the Polkadot-JS application.
     
      After you've verified that both nodes are running as expected, you can shut both nodes down. 

1. Shut down each node by pressing Control-C in each terminal.

## Generate your own keys

Now that you know how to start and connect running nodes as peers using command-line options, you are ready to generate you own secret keys instead of using the predefined account keys. 
Each participant in the blockchain network should generate unique keys. 

There are several ways you can generate keys.
For example, you can generate keypairs using the (<a target="_blank" href="/v3/tools/subkey">Subkey</a>) command-line program, the Polkadot-JS application, or third-party key generation utilties.

Although you could use pre-generated keypairs to complete this tutorial, you would never use those keys in a production environment.
Instead of using predefined keys or the `subkey` program, this tutorial illustrates how to generate keys using the Polkadot-JS application.

### Use Polkadot-JS to generate keys

You have already used the Polkadot-JS application to see blocks being produced for the nodes managed by Alice and Bob.
You can also use the Polkadot-JS application to generate keys to use with Substrate.

You can use the Polkadot-JS application to generate production keys.
However, you should never use a system connected to the internet to generate production keys.
Disconnecting from the internet is not required for this tutorial.

To use the Polkadot-JS application to generate keys:

1. Open the
[Polkadot-JS Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9945#/explorer) in a web browser.

1. On the **Accounts** tab, click **Add account**. 

1. You do not need to provide a name, although you may if
you would like to save this account for submitting transaction in addition to validating.

Generate an `sr25519` key which will be used by Aura for block production. Take careful note of the
mnemonic phrase, and the SS58 address which can be copied by clicking on the identicon in the top
left.

Then generate an `ed25519` key which will be used by GRANDPA for block finalization. Again, note
the mnemonic phrase and ss58 address.

In the next section, we will create a custom chain specification using your key pairs and
share your custom chain specicification with your network validators


## Create a Custom Chain Spec

Now that each participant has their own keys generated, you're ready to create a custom chain
specification. We will use this custom chain spec instead of the built-in `local` spec that we used
previously.

In this example we will create a two-node network, but the process generalizes to more nodes in a
straight-forward manner.

### Create a Chain Specification

Last time around, we used `--chain local` which is a predefined "chain spec" that has Alice and Bob
specified as validators along with many other useful defaults.

Rather than writing our chain spec completely from scratch, we'll just make a few modifications to
the one we used before. To start, we need to export the chain spec to a file named
`customSpec.json`. 

<Message
  type={`green`}
  title={`Tip`}
  text={`Further details about all of these commands are available by running: \`node-template --help\`.`}
/>

```bash
# Export the local chain spec to json
./target/release/node-template build-spec --disable-default-bootnode --chain local > customSpec.json
```

### Modify Aura authority nodes

The file we just created contains several fields, and you can learn a lot by exploring them. By far
the largest field is a single binary blob that is the Wasm binary of our runtime. It is part of what
you built earlier he `cargo build --release` command.

The portion of the file we're interested in is the Aura authorities used for creating blocks,
indicated by **"aura"** field below, and GRANDPA authorities used for finalizing blocks, indicated
by the **"grandpa"** field. That section looks like this using the [two provided demo keys](#option-3-use-pre-generated-keys):

```json
{
  //-- snip --
  "genesis": {
    "runtime": {
      "frameSystem": {
        //-- snip --
      },
      "palletAura": {
        "authorities": [
          "5FfBQ3kwXrbdyoqLPvcXRp7ikWydXawpNs2Ceu3WwFdhZ8W4",
          "5EhrCtDaQRYjVbLi7BafbGpFqcMhjZJdu8eW8gy6VRXh6HDp"
        ]
      },
      "palletGrandpa": {
        "authorities": [
          ["5G9NWJ5P9uk7am24yCKeLZJqXWW6hjuMyRJDmw4ofqxG8Js2", 1],
          ["5CRZoFgJs4zLzCCAGoCUUs2MRmuD5BKAh17pWtb62LMoCi9h", 1]
        ]
      }
      //-- snip --
    }
  }
}
```

    "These instructions are written for the node template. They will work with other Substrate-based 
    nodes with few modifications. In Substrate, nodes that include the session pallet should leave 
    the Aura and Grandpa configs empty and instead insert this information in the session config. All 
    of this is demonstrated in the chain spec you export from your desired node. 
    "
/>

The format for the Grandpa data is more complex because the Grandpa protocol supports weighted
votes. In this case we have given each validator a weight of **1**.

All we need to do is change the authority addresses listed (currently Alice and Bob) to our own
addresses that we generated in the previous step. The **sr25519** addresses go in the **aura**
section, and the **ed25519** addresses in the **grandpa** section. You may add as many validators as
you like. For additional context, read about
[keys in Substrate](/v3/advanced/cryptography#public-key-cryptography).

    same keys, they will produce conflicting blocks. 
    A single person should create the chain spec and share the resulting 
    `customSpecRaw.json` file with their fellow validators. 
    "
/> 

### Convert and share the raw chainspec
Once the chain spec is prepared, convert it to a "raw" chain spec. The raw chain spec contains all
the same information, but it contains the encoded storage keys that the node will use to reference
the data in its local storage. Distributing a raw spec ensures that each node will store the data at
the proper storage keys.

```bash
./target/release/node-template build-spec --chain=customSpec.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > customSpecRaw.json
```

Finally share the `customSpecRaw.json` with your all the other validators in the network.

Next steps:

- Launch the chain with the bootnode
- Add keys to keystore
- Add other participants to your network


## Launch Your Private Network

With your custom chain spec created and distributed to all participants, you're ready to launch your
own custom chain. In this section it is no longer required to use a single physical machine or a
single binary.

### First Participant Starts a Bootnode

You've completed all the necessary prep work and you're now ready to launch your chain. This process
is very similar to hed a chain earlier, as Alice and Bob. It's important to start with
a clean base path, so if you plan to use the same path that you've used previously, please delete
all contents from that directory.

The first participant can launch her node with:

```bash
# purge chain (only required for new/modified dev chain spec)
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --base-path /tmp/node01 --chain local -y
```

```bash
# start node01
./target/release/node-template \
  --base-path /tmp/node01 \
  --chain ./customSpecRaw.json \
  --port 30333 \
  --ws-port 9945 \
  --rpc-port 9933 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator \
  --rpc-methods Unsafe \
  --name MyNode01
```

Here are some differences from ed as Alice.

- I've omitted the `--alice` flag. Instead we will insert our own custom keys into the keystore
  through the RPC shortly.
- The `--chain` flag has changed to use our custom chain spec.
- I've added the optional `--name` flag. You may use it to give your node a human-readable name in
  the telemetry UI.
- The optional `--rpc-methods Unsafe` flag has been added. As the name indicates, this flag is not
  safe to use in a production setting, but it allows this tutorial to stay focused on the topic at
  hand.

You should see the console outputs something as follows:

Here you must take note of: 
- the **node identity**: `12D3KooWJvVUoAa7R8gjCSQ45x69Ahh3HcdVSH1dvpcA52vKawHL`
- the **IP address** `127.0.0.1`
- the p2p port `--port = 30333`

These values are for this specific
example, but for your node, they will be different and **required for other nodes to directly connect to it** 
(without a bootnode in the chain spec, as we removed in the flags before).

### Add Keys to Keystore

Once your node is running, you will again notice that no blocks are being produced. At this point,
you need to add your keys into the keystore. Remember you will need to complete these steps for each
node in your network. You will add two types of keys for each node: Aura and GRANDPA keys. Aura keys
are necessary for
[block _production_](/v3/getting-started/glossary#author);
GRANDPA keys are necessary for
[block _finalization_](/v3/getting-started/glossary#finality).

#### Option 1: Use the Polkadot-JS Apps UI

You can use the Apps UI to insert your keys into the keystore. Navigate to "Developer --> RPC Call". Choose
"author" and "insertKey". The fields can be filled like this:

![Inserting a Aura key using Apps](../../../src/images/tutorials/05-private-network/private-network-apps-insert-key-aura.png)

```
keytype: aura
suri: <your mnemonic phrase> (eg. clip organ olive upper oak void inject side suit toilet stick narrow)
publicKey: <your raw sr25519 key> (eg. 0x9effc1668ca381c242885516ec9fa2b19c67b6684c02a8a3237b6862e5c8cd7e)
```

<Message

      "If you generated your keys with the Apps UI you will not know your raw public key. In this case
      you may use your SS58 address (`5FfBQ3kwXrbdyoqLPvcXRp7ikWydXawpNs2Ceu3WwFdhZ8W4`) instead.
      "
/>

You've now successfully inserted your
[**Aura**](/v3/getting-started/glossary#aura-aka-authority-round)
key. You can repeat those steps to insert your
[**GRANDPA**](/v3/getting-started/glossary#grandpa) key (the
**ed25519** key)

![Inserting a GRANDPA key using Apps](../../../src/images/tutorials/05-private-network/private-network-apps-insert-key-gran.png)

```

suri: <your mnemonic phrase> (eg. clip organ olive upper oak void inject side suit toilet stick narrow)
publicKey: <your raw ed25519 key> (eg. 0xb48004c6e1625282313b07d1c9950935e86894a2e4f21fb1ffee9854d180c781)
```
<Message

  title={`Note`}
  text=
      "If you are following these steps for the _second_ node in the network, you must connect the UI to 
      the second node before inserting the keys.
      "
/>

#### Option 2: Use `curl`

You can also insert a key into the keystore by using [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) from the
command line. This approach may be preferable in a production setting, where you may be using a
cloud-based virtual private server.

Because security is of the utmost concern in a production environment, it is important to take every
precaution possible. In this case, that means taking care that you do not leave any traces of your
keys behind, such as in your terminal's history. Create a file that you will use to define the body
for your `curl` request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "author_insertKey",
  "params": ["<aura/gran>", "<mnemonic phrase>", "<public key>"]
}
```

```bash
# Submit a new key via RPC, connect to where your `rpc-port` is listening
curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d "@/path/to/file"
```

If you enter the command and parameters correctly, the node will return a JSON response as follows.

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": null, "id": 1 }
```

Make sure you delete the file that contains the keys one.

#### Option 3: Use the `key` command

Alternatively, you can insert a key saved to a local file using the `key` command:

```bash
# Insert the key from /path/to/key/file into the keystore
./target/release/node-template key insert --base-path /tmp/node01 --chain local --key-type <aura/gran> --suri /path/to/key/file
```

### Verify Keys in the Keystore (Optional)

Optionally, If you would like to check that your keys are now loaded, you can view the keystore files that should
now exists for your `node01`. These are found in the following (default example) location:

```bash
# The path stems from `--base-path` and ID from `chain_spec.rs` ID field.
# Keys are then in `chains/<chain ID>/keystore :
ls /tmp/node01/chains/local_testnet/keystore
```

```bash
## list of keystore files:
617572619effc1668ca381c242885516ec9fa2b19c67b6684c02a8a3237b6862e5c8cd7e
6772616eb48004c6e1625282313b07d1c9950935e86894a2e4f21fb1ffee9854d180c781

# read a keystore file (our demo seed 1 was used)
cat /tmp/node01/chains/local_testnet/keystore/617572619effc1668ca381c242885516ec9fa2b19c67b6684c02a8a3237b6862e5c8cd7e
"clip organ olive upper oak void inject side suit toilet stick narrow"
```

Notice there are two keystores, as expected as we added two keys to our node.
This example used [pair 1](#option-3-use-pre-generated-keys) from the well known seeds here, and
will use `pair 2` for our next node, where your keys may differ.

<!-- TODO: update below with example of successful use (not working for me at time of writing) -->

<!--
You can also set a non-standard keystore file for your node with the flags:
  keystore-path <PATH> - Specify custom keystore path
  keystore-uri <keystore-uri> - Specify custom URIs to connect to for keystore-services
-->

### Subsequent Participants Join

Subsequent validators can now join the network. This can be done by specifying the `--bootnodes`
parameter as Bob did previously.

```bash
# purge chain (only required for new/modified dev chain spec)
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --base-path /tmp/node02 --chain local -y

# start node02
./target/release/node-template \
  --base-path /tmp/node02 \
  --chain ./customSpecRaw.json \
  --port 30334 \
  --ws-port 9946 \
  --rpc-port 9934 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator \
  --rpc-methods Unsafe \
  --name MyNode02 \
  --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWAvdwXzjmRpkHpz8PzUTaX1o23SdpgAWVyTGMSQ68QXK6
  # you MUST fill the correct info in the line above:
  # --bootnodes /ip4/<IP Address>/tcp/<p2p Port>/p2p/<Peer ID>
```

<Message
  type={`red`}
  title={`Warning`}
  text=
    "Make sure you set the correct node ID! If you didn\'t set the correct node ID gathered from another running with the same chain spec,
    but only the right IP - you will get errors of the form: 
    `üíî The bootnode you want to connect to at ... provided a different peer ID than the one you expect: ...`
    "
/>

As before, we specify another `base-path`, give it another `name`, and also specify this node as a
`validator`.

**Block production**: Now you _must_ also set the authoring keys in this node, just as we did
[for the first node](#add-keys-to-keystore). Note that you will need to communicate with your node
on the correct `ws-port` (so setting the app UI and submitting `curl` to the right port is critical)
A node will not be able to produce blocks if it has not added its Aura key!
**Block finalization**: This can _only_ happen if more than two-thirds of the validators have added their
GRANDPA keys to their keystores. Since this network was configured with two validators (in the
chain spec), block finalization can occur after the second node has added its keys (i.e. 50% < 66% < 100%).

**Reminder:** All validators must be using _identical chain specifications_ in order to peer. You should
see the same genesis block and state root hashes.

Once the second node is running _and_ it has an authoring key, you should see both nodes reporting block authoring:

Congratulations! You've started your own private blockchain!

In this tutorial you've learned to generate your own keypairs, create a custom chain spec that uses
those keypairs, and start a private network based on your custom chain spec.
