In this tutorial you will start a Polkadot-like chain (the relay chain),
use <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus#readme">Cumulus</ExternalLink>
to create your own parachain, connect it to your relay chain, and interact with it in a local
test network.

### Learning outcomes

- Set up your parachain build environment
- Start a relay chain

## Prerequisites

### Hardware requirements

Compiling this project is a resource intensive process! We suggest using a machine with
**no less than**:

- 8 GB of RAM (16 is suggested)
- 4 CPU cores (8 is suggested)
- 50 GB of free HDD/SSD space

Without the minimal RAM here, you are likely to _run out of memory resulting in a `SIGKILL`
error_. This generally happens on the `polkadot-service` build so be sure to _monitor your RAM
usage_ (with something like <ExternalLink url="https://htop.dev/">`htop`</ExternalLink>) and
look out as swap memory starting to be used.

<Message
  type={`green`}
  title={`Tip`}
  text={`
If you cannot find a machine with the minimums here, try the following solution which trades longer
build time for more limited memory usage.
- Use less threads: cargo's \`-j\` flag specifies the number of threads to use to build. Try to use
one less than the CPU cores your machine has.
- Use cargo's [codegen units](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#codegen-units)
  feature makes more optimized builds, with less ram, but _much_ longer compile times.
\`\`\`bash
# use less codegen units
RUSTFLAGS="-C codegen-units=1" cargo build --release
# set the number of cores/threads to compile (used to build cumulus/polkadot on rpi 3)
cargo build --release -j 1

### Software versioning

<Message
  type={`red`}
  title={`Exact Versions Matter`}
  text={`
You **must** use the _exact_ versions mentioned below to ensure that you do not run into conflicts.
Parachain development is actively making breaking changes between commits on these repositories.
`}
/>

At the moment, parachains are _very tightly coupled_ with the relay chain's codebase they are
connecting to. If you want to connect your parachian to a **any** relay network, you _must_ be
sure that you are testing against the **exact same build of that relay chain**.

This tutorial has been tested on commits:

> - **Polkadot** tagged <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/v0.9.10">**`v0.9.10`**</ExternalLink>
> - **Parachain Template** tagged <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/> tree/polkadot-v0.9.10">**`polkadot-v0.9.10`**</ExternalLink>
> - **Polkadot-JS Apps** tagged <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/commit/> 1073f1b79bf0aec1c853441e3bbac614defce76e">**`v0.96.2-34`**</ExternalLink>
>   - It is generally expected that the [hosted Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
>     should work. If you have issues, build and run this UI yourself, at this tagged version.

We're doing our best to keep the parachain template and this tutorial updated presently
with the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases">latest release of Polkadot.</ExternalLink>

Please check-in with us on the <ExternalLink url="https://matrix.to/#/#parachain-technical:matrix.parity.io"> Parachain Technical matrix channel </ExternalLink>
when the latest version is not what is listed in this tutorial, report any issues you run into, and
get further support.

## Build your nodes

In case you have not already, follow the instructions to
[setup a local development environment](/v3/getting-started/overview) for Substrate.

### Building the relay chain node

Clone the Polkadot repository (that will serve as our relay chain), and build the node:

```bash
# Clone the Polkadot Repository
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git

# Switch into the Polkadot directory
cd polkadot

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout v0.9.10

# Build the relay chain Node
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/polkadot --help
```

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Polkadot node.

For the rest of this tutorial, we will refer to this binary simply as `polkadot`.

### Building the parachain template

We will use the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template"> Parachain Template </ExternalLink>
(similar but not identical to the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template"> Node Template </ExternalLink>
) to launch our first parachain and make cross-chain asset transfers. Later, we will use it as the starting
point for developing our own parachains.

In a new terminal window:

```bash
# Clone the Parachain Template
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template

# Switch into the Parachain Template directory
cd substrate-parachain-template

# Checkout the proper commit
git checkout polkadot-v0.9.10

# Build the parachain template collator
cargo build --release

# Check if the help page prints to ensure the node is built correctly
./target/release/parachain-collator --help
```

If the help page is printed, you have succeeded in building a Cumulus-based parachain collator.

For the rest of this tutorial we will refer to it simply as `parachain-collator`.

## Relay chain specification

You will need a chain specification ([chain spec](/v3/runtime/chain-specs))
for your relay chain network.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`Important`}
  text={`
Always have one or more relay chain validator node running than the total connected parachains. For
example, if you want to connect two parachains, run three or more relay chain validator nodes.
`}
/>

Whichever chain spec file you choose to use we will refer to the file simply as `chain-spec.json`
in the instructions below. You will need to supply the proper path to the chain spec you are using.

<Message
  type={`gray`}
  title={`Note`}
  text={`
If you intend to let others connect to your network, you should have the genesis Wasm and the
associated chain spec for your network generated once and distributed to your peers.
This stems from the [non-deterministic issue](https://dev.to/gnunicorn/hunting-down-a-non-determinism-bug-in-our-rust-wasm-build-4fk1)
in the way Wasm runtimes are compiled, at least for now.
`}
/>

Chain specification files to connect to an existing network _conventionally_ live in a `/res` folder
that is published in your node's codebase for others to use. As an example:

- Polkadot includes these **relay chain** chain spec files <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res"> here </ExternalLink>
- Cumulus includes these **parachain** chain spec files <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/polkadot-parachains/res"> here </ExternalLink>

### Pre-configured chain spec files

We have included three chain spec files that you can use **without modification** for a
local test network:

- <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chainspecs/rococo-custom-2-raw.json" download>
    rococo-custom-2-raw.json
  </a>
  : A two-validator relay chain with Alice and Bob as authorities. Useful for registering a single parachain.

- <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chainspecs/rococo-custom-3-raw.json" download>
    {' '}
    rococo-custom-3-raw.json{' '}
  </a>
  : A three-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-local` spec, with Charlie as the third validator.

- <a href="/assets/tutorials/cumulus/chainspecs/rococo-custom-4-raw.json" download>
    rococo-custom-4-raw.json
  </a>
  : A four-validator relay chain identical to `rococo-local` spec, with Charlie and Dave as the third
  and fourth validators.

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for your inspection. If
you use a **plain** chain spec (human readable) you want to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw**
chain spec to use when starting your nodes. Jump to the
[conversion](#convert-plain-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

These specs were created according to the steps in the
[create your own chain spec](#create-a-custom-chain-spec) section.

## Start your relay chain

Before we can attach any cumulus-based parachains, we need to launch a relay chain to connect to.
This page describes in detail how to start both nodes using the two-validator `rococo-custom-2-raw.json`
chain spec that ships with this tutorial as well as the general instructions for starting additional
nodes.

### Start the `alice` validator

```bash
# Start Relay `Alice` node
polkadot \
--alice \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay/alice \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--port 30333 \
--ws-port 9944
```

The port and websocket port specified here are the defaults and thus those flags can be omitted.
However we've chosen to leave them in to enforce the habit of checking their values. Because Alice
is using the defaults, no other nodes on the relay chain or parachains can use these ports.

When the node starts you will see several log messages. **Take note of the node's Peer ID**
in the logs. We will need it when connecting other nodes to it. It will look something like
this:

```bash
🏷 Local node identity is: 12D3KooWGjsmVmZCM1jPtVNp6hRbbkGBK3LADYNniJAKJ19NUYiq
```

### Start the `bob` validator

```bash
polkadot \
--bob \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-bob \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--bootnodes /ip4/<Alice IP>/tcp/30333/p2p/<Alice Peer ID> \
--port 30334 \
--ws-port 9945
```

Bob's command is perfectly analogous to Alice's. It differs concretely from Alice's in that Bob has
specified his own base path, provided his own validator keys (`--bob`), and used his own ports.
Finally he has added a `--bootnodes` flag. This bootnodes flag is not strictly necessary if you are
running the entire network on a single local system, but it is necessary when operating over the
network, so I've chosen to leave it in.

### Starting additional validators (optional)

If you are using the `rococo-custom-2-raw.json` spec, you do not need to start additional nodes, but
others may need to start more nodes. Again, this command is entirely analogous. You just need to
make sure that nodes on the same physical system do not have conflicting ports or base paths.

```bash
polkadot \
--charlie \
--validator \
--base-path /tmp/relay-charlie \
--chain <path to spec json> \
--port 30335 \
--ws-port 9946
```

If you would like even more validators, or to customize the relay chain in some other ways, keep
reading!

## Create a custom relay chain spec (optional)

It is generally best to start from an existing specification to minimize chances of
error. Once you are familiar with the overall flow, use the following steps to customize and
generate your own chain specs.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`note`}
  text={`
Your final spec _must_ start with the word \`rococo\` or the node will not know what runtime logic
to include.
`}
/>

### Generate a Plain Chain Spec

```bash
# Create a base chain spec that we will modify
polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-local --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom-plain.json
```

That file contains most of the information we need already. Rococo is a permissioned chain, so
we just need to add an authority and its session keys. The snippet below shows the relevant part of
the generated spec file. All keys in the generated file belong to the usual well known accounts used
in other tutorials (Alice and Bob in the case of the `rococo-custom-plain.json` file).

```json
"session": {
  "keys": [
    [
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",                           // <---- The Validator Authority (//Alice//stash)
      "5GNJqTPyNqANBkUVMN1LPPrxXnFouWXoe2wNSmmEoLctxiZY",
      {
        "grandpa": "5FA9nQDVg267DEd8m1ZypXLBnvN7SFxYwV7ndqSYGiN9TTpu",              // <---- The GRANDPA ed25519 session key (//Alice)
        "babe": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",                 // <---- The sr25519 session keys (//Alice)
        "im_online": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "para_validator": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",

        "authority_discovery": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
        "beefy": "KW39r9CJjAVzmkf9zQ4YDb2hqfAVGdRqn53eRqyruqpxAP5YL",               // <---- The BEEFY *encoded* ecdsa session keys (//Alice)
       }
    ]
  // -- snip -- ADD MORE KEYS HERE, following the same format
  ]
}
```

Plain chain spec files are in a more human readable and modifiable format for your inspection. If
you use a **plain** chain spec you will need to convert it to a SCALE encoded **raw**
chain spec to use to pass to your nodes on startup. Jump to the
[conversion](#convert-plain-to-raw-chain-spec) section to see how to do that.

### Adjust the Chain Spec

<Message
  type={`gray`}
  title={`Note`}
  text={`
The addition of custom session keys in the plain chain spec as discussed in this section is
not needed for **production chains**, as these are generated for you in the included chain spec
files in \`node/service/res\` folder of Polkadot. The exercise below is used because you are
you would need to recompile your node only to adding authorities. Minor edits on a plain base
chain spec is useful in this case, but most of the time you will want to include these in your
\`chain-spec.rs\`, generate the node binary, and finally use the CLI to generate your custom chain
spec.
`}
/>

Add your new authority's `AccountId` and `ValidatorId`.

In this runtime configuration, both IDs are the same and are generated from the "stash" account. You
can generate your own or inspect the
[well-known development accounts](/v3/tools/subkey#well-known-keys).

The following commands demonstrate how the first part of the `palletSession` section inside the
spec file can be reproduced. The second part is obtained similarly with `//Bob` and `//Bob//stash`.

<Message
  type={`yellow`}
  title={`note`}
  text={`
All the keys and addresses needed can be generated and inspected using either:
- The stand-alone [\`subkey\` tool](/v3/tools/subkey) (v2.0.1 and above for BEEFY keys)
- The node \`key\` subcommand, included in all substrate node CLIs
The commands are equivalent for either one you choose.

And finally the **encoded SS58** ecdsa BEEFY key:

```bash
subkey inspect --scheme ecdsa --network substrate //Alice
```

_Output:_

```
Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:

  SS58 Address:      5C7C2Z5sWbytvHpuLTvzKunnnRwQxft1jiqrLD5rhucQ5S9X
```

Now that you have all the keys you need, append them in the `palletSession` section of you _plain_ spec file.
You can either create new IDs or use other well known accounts following this same process.

#### A note on SS58 encoding of `key` vs. `address`

Notice the BEEFY key is the `Public key (SS58)` and it's _different_ from the `SS58 Address` in the
case of ECDSA keys.

In the case of sr25519 and ed25519, the account ID matches its public key, hence SS58 encoded
account-id address is the same as SS58 public key encoding. In case of ECDSA, we apply blake2 algorithm to the public key to get the address (due to the size
difference between 33 vs 32 bytes), so the SS58 encoding is different.

Default serialization / deserialization implementation for public keys is using SS58 encoding,
hence every time we use public keys in encoded form we are going to need it's SS58 encoding. A
notable case is chain spec JSON file and encoding of session keys (most importantly BEEFY).

### Convert plain to raw chain spec

Now that you've modified your chain spec, you can generate the final raw spec file.

```bash
polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-custom-plain.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > rococo-custom.json
```

You may get the output warning: `Took active validators from set with wrong size`.
The resulting `chain-spec.json` will still be **perfectly usable**, you can ignore this warning for
now.

### Start the relay chain and insert keys

If your custom chain spec includes self-generated keys, see the
[Substrate private network tutorial](/tutorials/v3/private-network#add-keys-to-keystore)
for details on inserting these keys into your various nodes.
