The [Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
provides a minimal working runtime which you can use to quickly get started with building your own custom
blockchain. However, in the attempts to remain minimal, it does not include most of the pallets from
[FRAME](../../knowledgebase/runtime/frame).

This guide will show you how you can add the
[Contracts pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_contracts/) to your runtime in order to
allow your blockchain to support Wasm smart contracts. You can follow similar patterns to add
additional FRAME pallets to your runtime, however you should note that each pallet is a little
different in terms of the specific configuration settings needed to use it correctly.

## What you will be doing 

1. [Setup](/v3/tutorials/add-contracts/pt1): Install and modify the Node Template to include dependencies for the Contracts pallet.
2. [Implement the Contracts Pallet](/v3/tutorials/add-contracts/pt2): Add runtime implementation and implement custom runtime API and RPC endpoints.
3. [Launch your node](/v3/tutorials/add-contracts/pt2#5-start-your-upgraded-chain)

## Learning outcomes

- Include and use a FRAME pallet in a Substrate node
- Implement the contracts pallet and its runtime API 
- Configure a node's RPC endpoints
