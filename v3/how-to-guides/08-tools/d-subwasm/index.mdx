[Subwasm](https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm) provides a way to expose the features of the runtime for any Substrate chain. 
This guide steps through the different capabilities that Subwasm provides. 

## Use cases

- Expose verifiable historical information of a chain's runtime for front end applications.
- Get a quick snapshot of the modules in a runtime.
- Check for changes between runtimes using a diff.
- Expose a verifiable runtime for governance transparency.

## Before you begin

To follow this guide you should have a runtime from a chain you wish to query. 
This could either be one running locally or one running in production.
In order to filter metadata, you will also need to [install JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

## Install and discover the CLI tool

To get started, install Subwasm and explore its commands.

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm --tag v0.16.1
```
Make sure you're using the [latest release](https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm/releases). 
This guide is based on version 0.14.1. 

Explore the CLI commands.

```bash
subwasm --help
```

## Get information about a runtime 

1. Launch a local node from inside your chain's directory. 
   This example is launching the node template in dev mode.
   
    ```bash
    ./target/release/node-template --tmp --dev
    ```

1. In a new terminal, create a temporary folder and use Subwasm to get and save the Wasm of your local chain.

    ```bash
    mkdir TempWasms && cd TempWasms
    subwasm get ws://localhost:9944 -o mychain.wasm
    ```

1. Run the following command to save your chain's metadata to a JSON file:

   ```bash
    subwasm --json meta mychain.wasm | jq 'del( .. | .documentation? )' > mychain-metadata.json
   ```

   Using JQ is a useful tool to filter the metadata details from the `subwasm --json meta mychain.wasm` command.
   In this case, we're choosing to ignore all documentation metadata.
   You can have a look at the different metadata fields a Substrate chain exposes [here](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate).

1. Use the custom metadata file in a front-end application. 

## Compare two different runtimes

Using Subwasm, we can also compare the runtimes of a chain at different blocks. 
In this example, we'll take Polkadot's runtime at block 500 and compare it with its latest runtime.

1. Go to a block explorer and retrieve the block hash for the runtime your want to compared against.

    For example, go to [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/explorer) and retrieve the block hash at [block 50000](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/explorer/query/50000).

    `0xfdeab19649426aadbdab046c9b5dac0a5b0c850b8fd0927e3b4e6c896d5fb0b7`

1. Save the Wasm blob of a previous state.

    ```bash
    subwasm get --chain polkadot --block 0xfdeab19649426aadbdab046c9b5dac0a5b0c850b8fd0927e3b4e6c896d5fb0b7 -o polkadot-500000.wasm
    ```

1. Get the latest Wasm blob of the runtime.

    ```bash
    subwasm get --chain polkadot -o polkadot-latest.wasm 
    ```

1. Compare the two runtimes and put the output into a JSON file.

    ```bash
    subwasm diff polkadot-latest.wasm polkadot-500000.wasm --json > polkadot-wasm-diff.json
    ```

## Examples 

There are many uses cases for `subwasm` as outlined above.
Some additional examples include:
- Compressing and decompressing a Wasm file.
- Inspecting a Wasm file to verify a runtime upgrade in governance.
