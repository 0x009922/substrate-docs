[Subwasm](https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm) provides a way to expose all of the features and functionalities of the runtime of any Substrate chain. 
Any runtime can be queried for an exhaustive list of a chain's metadata and specifications without needing to rely on the Wasm running on a node.

This guide steps through the different capabilities that Subwasm provides. 

## Use cases

- Expose verifiable historical information of a chain's runtime. 
- Get a quick snapshot of the modules in a runtime.
- Check for changes between runtimes using a diff 

## Before you begin

To follow this guide you should have a chain you wish to query. 
You can either [download existing Wasm binaries]() or use ones generated from your own chains. 
In order to filter metadata, you will also need to [install JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).


## Install and discover the CLI tool

To get started:

1. Install Subwasm.

    ```bash
    cargo install --git https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm --tag v0.14.1 --locked
    ```

    Make sure you're using the [latest release](https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm/releases). 
    This guide is based on version 0.14.1. 

1. Explore the CLI commands.

    ```bash
    subwasm --help
    ```

## Get information about a runtime 

1. Launch a local node from inside your chain's directory. 
   This example is launching the node template in dev mode.
   
   ```bash
    ./target/release/node-template --tmp --dev
   ```

1. In a new terminal, create a temporary folder and use Subwasm to get and save the Wasm of your local chain.

  ```bash
  mkdir TempWasms && cd TempWasms
  subwasm get ws://localhost:9944 -o mychain.wasm
  ```

1. Run the following command to save your chain's metadata to a JSON file:

   ```bash
    subwasm --json meta mychain.wasm | jq 'del( .. | .documentation? )' > mychain-metadata.json
   ```

   Using JQ is a useful tool to filter the metadata details from the `subwasm --json meta mychain.wasm` command.
   In this case, we're choosing to ignore all documentation metadata.
   You can have a look at the different metadata fields a Substrate chain exposes [here](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate).

1. Use the custom metadata file in a front-end application.
