## Overview

You have used off-chain workers fetching some valuable data, or processing some very conclusive data. Now you want to save it on-chain. How do you go about that? Here, we introduce three methods:

- **Signed transactions** - use this when you want to record the associated transaction caller and deducting the transaction fee from the caller account.
- **Unsigned transactions** - use this when you **DO NOT** want to record the associated caller.
- **Unsigned transactions with signed payload** - use this when you want to record the associated transaction caller, but do not want the caller be responsible for the transaction fee payment.
