## Overview

You have used off-chain workers fetching some valuable data, or processing some very conclusive data. Now you want to save it on-chain. How do you go about that? Here, we introduce three methods:

- **Signed transactions** - use this when you want to record the associated transaction caller and deducting the transaction fee from the caller account.
- **Unsigned transactions** - use this when you **DO NOT** want to record the associated caller.
- **Unsigned transactions with signed payload** - use this when you want to record the associated transaction caller, but do not want the caller be responsible for the transaction fee payment.

## Steps for signed transactions

1. Call the life-cycle hook of off-chain workers in your pallet, as follows:

  ```rust
  #[pallet::hooks]
  impl<T: Config> Hooks<BlockNumberFor<T>> for Pallet<T> {
    /// Offchain Worker entry point.
    ///
    /// By implementing `fn offchain_worker` you declare a new offchain worker.
    /// This function will be called when the node is fully synced and a new best block is
    /// succesfuly imported.
    /// Note that it's not guaranteed for offchain workers to run on EVERY block, there might
    /// be cases where some blocks are skipped, or for some the worker runs twice (re-orgs),
    /// so the code should be able to handle that.
    /// You can use `Local Storage` API to coordinate runs of the worker.
    fn offchain_worker(block_number: T::BlockNumber) {
      log::info!("Hello from pallet-ocw.");
      // The entry point of your code called by off-chain worker
    }
    // ...
  }
  ```
