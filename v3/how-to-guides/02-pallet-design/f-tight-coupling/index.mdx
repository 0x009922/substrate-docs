This guide will show you how to use an external pallet's capabilities from inside your pallet.

Tight coupling two pallets may suit specific use cases where an outside pallet contains many types and methods common to those of your initial pallet. If this is not the case, you can use loose coupling instead. To learn more, see [pallet coupling](/v3/runtime/pallet-coupling).


## Before you begin

1. Configure your workspace

Assume you want to use a pallet called `special-pallet`, which is a pallet in your 
local workspace. Import it by providing its path in your pallet's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
special-pallet = { path = '../special-pallet', default-features = false }
```

### 2. Add a trait bound to your pallet 

Now all you need to do is create a trait bound around your pallet's configuration trait:

```rust
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config + special_pallet::Config {
    // --snip--
}
```

### 3. Use getter function 

In order to use a method from `special_pallet`, call it the following way:

```rust
// Get the members from the vec-set pallet
let who = special_pallet::Pallet::<T>::get();
```

The above snippet assumes that `special_pallet` contains a method called `get()`.
