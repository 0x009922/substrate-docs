This guide will show you how to use a method from an external pallet inside your pallet.

Tight coupling two pallets may suit specific use cases where an outside pallet contains many types and methods common to those of your initial pallet. 
If this is not the case, you can use loose coupling instead. 
To learn more, see [pallet coupling](/v3/runtime/pallet-coupling).


## Before you begin

This guide assumes you have a pallet that you would like to couple another pallet with.
Use the [template pallet](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/blob/main/pallets/template/src/lib.rs) if you don't yet have a pallet to work with.

1. Configure your workspace

    Assume you want to use a pallet called `special-pallet`, which is a pallet in your local workspace. 
    Import it by providing its path in your pallet's `Cargo.toml` file:

    ```toml
    special-pallet = { path = '../special-pallet', default-features = false }
    ```

1. Add a trait bound to your pallet

    Now all you need to do is create a trait bound around your pallet's configuration trait:

    ```rust
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config + special_pallet::Config {
        // --snip--
    }
    ```

1. Use a getter function 

    In order to use a method from `special_pallet`, call it the following way:

    ```rust
    // Get the members from the vec-set pallet
    let who = special_pallet::Pallet::<T>::get();
    ```

    The above snippet assumes that `special_pallet` contains a method called `get()`.
