This guide goes over a simple way to assign an account ID to an origin. This origin could be used 
from within the pallet its defined in but also in any other pallet it is tightly coupled to.

## Use cases

- Create a special origin with Sudo-like access to specific dispatchables
- Implement a dispatchable that can only be called by the origin defined from another pallet.

Create a custom origin with a specified account ID and enforce it in a signed dispatchable.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, verify the following requirements:

- You already have a working pallet and dispatchable to implement a custom origin for.
- Read about Substrate's [origin system](/v3/runtime/origins/) to understand what they are and ways to use them.
